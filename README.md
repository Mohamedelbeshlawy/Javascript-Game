## Gameplay

Galaxy Fighter is a game in which the player controls a rocket, which moves
persistently to the right. The player is tasked with navigating the rocket
through pairs of obstacles that have non-equally sized gaps placed at random
heights. As the time passes, the level becomes more difficult and more obstacles
are generated and needed to be avoided. Each successful pass through a pair of
obstacles awards the player one life. Colliding with an obstacle or the ground takes one life.
